Because 8.x is in active flux, this tutorial falls out of date really easily.

When performing an update, here are the steps:

0) Do a clone of what's there into your desktop or something in a folder called
   "pants-bak-DO-NOT-PULL" or similar. This will be your reference repo.

   cd ~/Desktop
   git clone --branch 8.x-1.x webchick@git.drupal.org:project/pants.git OMG


1) Do a clone of the 7.x-1.x version into your Drupal 8 site:

   cd ~/Sites/8.x/modules
   git clone --branch 7.x-1.x webchick@git.drupal.org:project/pants.git
   cd pants

2) Grab local copies of all remote branches:

   # Thanks, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/379081/track-all-remote-git-branches-as-local-branches
   for remote in `git branch -r | grep -v master `; do git checkout --track $remote ; done

3) Delete the existing branches from the remote repo. Else you can't rebase.

   git branch -a
   # Do this per branch... note the ":" is the part that means deletion. Eff
   # you, Git.
   git push origin :8.x-01-basics
   git push origin :8.x-02-tests
   ...

4) Now, walk through the steps until they don't work. If they don't, you need
   to rebase. Here's how to do that.

   For example, between DrupalCon Sydney and DrupalCon Portland, we changed
   the .info file extension to .info.yml. So before we add core = 8.x, we need
   to add a step that renames the file. This affects all branches.

   # Delete the remote branch.
   git push origin :8.x-01-basics

   # Switch to the 8.x-01-basics branch.
   git checkout 8.x-01-basics

   # Rename the .info file.
   git mv pants.info pants.info.yml

   # Commit it.
   git commit -m "Renaming pants.info to pants.info.yml."

   # Rebase it.
   git rebase -i 7.x-1.x

   # In rebase, move the commit message to the top of the list from the bottom.
   "Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/8.x-01-basics."

   # Now, push it live.
